## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ringgold Atienza

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m currently interested in AI, Deep Learning, and Machine Learning. I am a transitionist (academe to machine learning practitioner). 

For a long time, I have been working with statistics in behavioral research, in an academic setting. I have been trained heavily in traditional statistics such as classical linear regression, t-test, and general hypothesis testing. I also did love working on time-series and econometric data. Moreover, most of my past research publication deals with structural equation modeling â€“ which to my surprise, is not so popular on the tech side but very popular in the academe for theory building. In academe, top journals require more than cross-sectional data â€“ as such, you must present multi-level or multi-wave data to solidify claims on a particular hypothesis. Academe is very rigid in terms of theory-building.

Now, I want to explore the practical side of dealing with data. This might be a new domain for me, but I hope I will enjoy this journey!
